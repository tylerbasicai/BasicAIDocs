Admin - Create and Manage: Teams, Users, Projects, Templates, and Workflows Team - Preform annotations and assign work. API - Protocols for interfacing via API. Module Overview The BasicAI Platform (both Cloud and OnPrem) consists of 3 primary modules. Each module requires its own login credentials by design, for property authentication and permissioning. Admin Module The Admin module is the \u201cfront end\u201d of the BasicAI platform, designed to enable customers and BasicAI to create and define new Projects, Templates, Users, and Teams. Admin also includes a dashboard that enables users to view the status of these elements. There is also a \u201cCompany\u201d dashboard which shows the Annotation Modules that are provisioned for the Company (Org) account, and the overall utilization of available storage space. Each Project starts with a detailed set of requirements. In BasicAI Cloud platform, the BasicAI team will work with the customer to develop detailed requirements and create annotation template(s) for each Task, using the Admin module of BasicAI Cloud platform. BasicAI manages this process directly for clients who utilize our annotation services. For BasicAI OnPrem, the client will define their own requirements and templates. Root Module The Root module is the \u201cback end\u201d of the BasicAI platform, designed to enable operations staff (BasicAI staff for Cloud, Customer staff for OnPrem) to provision tenants, user credentials and roles, teams, annotation categories, templates, acceleration/boost tools, etc. For BasicAI OnPrem, an unpopulated version of Root will be provided for private cloud or on-premises deployment. Team Module The Team module is designed to be accessed by managers and workers in order to review and execute assigned tasks. In BasicAI Cloud, staff from BasicAI\u2019s affiliated partners are provided access to perform and submit their work. For BasicAI OnPrem, the Team module can be used by internal staff resources assigned to manage and perform labeling tasks. Role Definitions Admin Manager Full admin rights Admin Operator Limited admin rights (what is limited) Root Manager Full root module rights Root Operator Limited root module rights Team Manager Person who manages a team of Workers Team Operator (aka Worker) Person who does the annotation work. Auditor A Person assigned by the Team Manager to perform audit work. This is not a formal role within the platform, but it is an informal role that may be assigned. Project Unit Definitions Project The entire project engagement for an individual customer. Each Project is assigned a unique ID number. Task Each Project is divided into a number of Tasks related to the Project ID. Tasks may be bundled together in Batches. Tasks are assigned to individual Workers, including Audit Tasks Audit Task After Tasks are completed by Workers for the first time, a new set of Audit Tasks are made available to the assigned Auditor Team Manager Person who manages the entire team of Workers. Worker Person who does the annotation work. Auditor The Person assigned by Team Manager to perform audit work Project Phase Definitions In the BasicAI platform, there are three general phases during each project. These phases can be configured and customized many different ways to fit the needs of a particular project: Execute This phase is the initial annotation work done by the individual workers on a team. Audit In this phase, an assigned Auditor (often the Team Leader) will review the annotation work done in the Execute phase. Our standard suggestion is to audit 100% of the work done in the Execute phase, but the platform can be configured to select a lower % sample rate. Acceptance In this phase, a supervisor or manager will review all or a proportion of the audited work for final approval before sending to client.","title":"Platform Overview"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-basicai-platform-documentation","text":"","title":"Welcome to the BasicAI Platform Documentation"},{"location":"#definitions","text":"Root - Configure what the Admin and Team Platforms can view.

Platform Login As a admin user, you will log into the platform through below URL https://admin.saas.basic.ai/login (SAAS) https://admin.sandbox.basic.ai/login (Sandbox) 1 Project Management(Admin Manager) Let\u2019s take creating an image annotation project as an example. 1.1 Create Project Log in to the Admin platform, then click [Business]\u2014>[Project Management]\u2014>[Create project] After clicking [Create project], you will enter project type page as below: Select project type as [Object Recognition(2D Bbox)] before clicking [Create project] 1.2 Project Basic Information Basic information for creating a project include category, project name, start & end time, and Upload data package. Category: It is the project type you choose when you create a project. Project name: It would help the project administrator/manager search and manage projects conveniently. Start & end time: This determines the execution period of the project. An operator can only execute tasks in the project within this period. Upload data package: There are three ways to upload your data: web page, SSH, and FTP (with permissions). Through web page: Click the rectangle area shown in the image below to select to-be-annotated files, or drag the files into the area. Via SSH and FTP: When there is an enormous amount of data to be annotated, SSH and FTP, with special tools, can be used for uploading the data. In addition, uploading via FTP requires permission from us. Publish project: After filling all the project information, click [publish project], then you successfully created a project on the platform. 1.3 Project Configuration On the project list, projects are sorted according to the time they have been created so users can easily find the latest projects. When a project is not configured, the [configuration] button will be highlighted in orange to remind the project administrator to configure it. In the following instruction, let\u2019s find a newly created project and start configuring it by clicking the [configuration] button. 1.3.1 Allocate Batch To configure a project, the first step is to divide data into numerous batches for the sake of project management and data exporting. This platform provides three methods to divide data: allocate by category, allocate equally according to the total amount, and freely allocation. Data division is only suitable for dealing with a tremendous amount of data requiring management of various batches. If a project does not need to divide its data into batches, the project administrator/manager can skip the step by simply clicking [Save] on the page and then clicking [Confirm, next step] in an ensuing pop-up window. 1.3.2 Setup Process The second step is to set the processes of a project. Processes are defined in three types based on their functionality: execution, audit, and quality inspection. These three processes can be added, deleted, edited and re-arranged in any projects. By setting a parent node for each process, you can determine the sequence of different processes. In the image above, execution is the parent node of audit, while audit is the parent node of quality inspection. 1.3.2.1 Execution Execution is the process in which an operator or an AI model generates results by collecting, cleaning or annotating. \u201cWhen configuring an \u201cexecution\u201d process, you need to set the category of the process and select a template. Set process category: Set a template: [Use Copy Template]: This button will allow you to create a new template by copying the original template, without changing the content of the original one. [Use this template]: This button will allow you to use the original template without creating a new one. If you apply any changes to the template, other projects using it will update their template as well. This feature is suitable for long-term projects. Tip: For public templates, the platform only allows users to copy them. If you want to edit a public template, please check [Category/Classification Management] on Root platform. After confirming a template, you can edit it or choose another template by clicking the corresponding buttons below. 1.3.2.2 Audit The \u201caudit\u201d process is where job results from the last process are approved, rejected or reset. When setting an \u201caudit\u201d process, a parent node must be set for auditors to examine all jobs submitted. 1.3.2.3 Quality Inspection Like audit, \u201cquality inspection\u201d also examines jobs, except that it does not have to go through all jobs submitted. Spot check can be done here. It is recommended that a quality inspection process be set at the end of a workflow. Serial Processes: Parallel Processes: The image below demonstrates the processes of a task involving image transcription and bounding box. The quality inspection process has two parent nodes: Bbox audit and transcription audit. Click [Save,next step] to the third step. 1.3.3 Set Tasks According to batches and processes set before, a project will be divided into various tasks. The third step of project configuration is to set the number of sheets that can be claimed each time for every task, define execution time, and assign the tasks to various teams, so as to achieve dynamic productivity management. Number of tasks number of batches*number of processes For example, when there are 2 batches and 3 processes for each batch, there will be a total of 6 tasks. By clicking [Settings] you can set the execution conditions for a task. [Select target] allows you to select annotation teams, crowdsourcing or models to execute the task. Click [Save] to save the settings. Click [Save settings] to complete setting. Definitions: Task name: The name of a task when it is available on the Team platform. Number of jobs claimed each time: The number of jobs or sheets cached by the system for an operator when he/she is executing tasks. When the operator finishes the cached jobs, the same amount of new jobs will be cached automatically. Start time: The time when a task becomes available on the Team platform. End time: After the end time, operators will not be able to execute the task, while their performance will be kept. Platform: Determine what platform the execution subject comes from. Target: When you have chosen \u201cteam\u201d in platform selection, you can select a valid team for this option; when you have chosen \u201cAI model\u201d in platform selection, you can select a valid AI model for this option. [Batch settings] By checking the boxes on the left side of the task list, or click [Select all and execute][Select all and audit][Select all and inspect], you can set multiple tasks at once. 1.4 Export Annotation Results (Admin Manager) When the project administrator/manager logs in to the Admin platform, he/she can enter the project detail page by clicking [Project Management] on the left panel and then clicking the name of a project presented on the page. On the project detail page, click [Download Results] to enter the download page. When downloading results, you must select: Download batch: One or more batches of the project; Download steps: You must select one process of the project for downloading results. When you choose the \u201cexecution\u201d process, submitted jobs in the execution process will be downloaded; when you choose the \u201caudit\u201d process, approved jobs in the audit process will be downloaded; and when you choose the \u201cquality inspection\u201d process, all jobs under quality inspection will be downloaded. Download file format: You can select one of various file formats based on your needs. If you require results in various formats, you have to download them separately in different formats. Configuration options: By setting the options, you can decide whether the results need to be translated into Chinese and whether to filter out empty results. Time: You can download job data in a package from a specific period of time. After setting all the options above, when you click [Pack data], to-be-downloaded data will appear on the list as shown below. When the status of data turns into \u201cPacked successfully\u201d, it means the data is ready to be downloaded. If you want to download multiple packages at once, you can check the boxes on the left side of the list. This requires turning off the [block pop-ups] feature in browser settings. To disable the feature in Chrome, go to [Settings]\u2014> [Advanced]\u2014>[Site Settings]\u2014>[Pop-ups and redirects] to turn it off. 2.Template Management The project administrator/manager is able to enter the template editing page through the [Template Management] button or when setting the processes of a project. The editing page is divided into three areas: module selection, template preview, and module attribute editing. For image tasks, Layout module is often used to split the page into two parts: the left part is for image preview, and the right part is for tag selection or transcription. This arrangement is shown as below: For Single-choice, Multiple-choice, Single-row input and Multiple-row input modules, there are more instructions as follows: 2.1 Single-Choice/Multiple-Choice Modules For Single-choice/Multiple-choice modules, the attribute editing area features following functions: [Add option] By clicking this button, you can add a new option. [Delete option] By clicking the trash can icon to the right of an option, you can delete the option immediately. [Drag option] By pressing and dragging the triple-strip icon to the left of an option, you can change the position of the option. [Set default option] By checking the boxes on the left, you can decide which options are set as default. \u3010Hotkeys\u3011 Click this button to enable hotkeys. After selecting the button, press a letter or a number on the keyboard to set it as the hotkey for an option. For instance, in the picture below the hotkey for option \u201cValid\u201d is set as \u201c1\u201d, the hotkey function for option \u201cInvalid\u201d has been activated without actually setting a hotkey, whereas option \u201cNot sure\u201d has not had the feature activated. 2.2 Single-Row/Multiple-Row Input Modules These two modules are introduced for an operator to input text. The difference between a single-row input module and a multiple-row input module in task configuration is that the latter has an icon in the lower-right corner. In terms of task execution, the single-row input module is shown within a height of one-row text and no word wrap, whereas the multiple-row input module is shown within a maximum height of triple-row text. In addition, if the text exceeds the triple-row height of the multiple-row input module, a scrollbar will appear on the right to allow the module to fit more characters. 2.3 Data Cleaning Module This module is used to determine whether an assignment is valid and whether it needs editing. When \u201cYes\u201d is chosen for the validity option, assignments with empty or unqualified results cannot be submitted by an operator. When a tag is set as a necessity, an assignment can be submitted only if its results involve that particular tag. When \u201cNo/Unknown\u201d is chosen for the validity option, no examination of results is required for submitting assignments. In the labeling process, if there is no result, the assignment cannot be submitted: If the result does not contain a necessary tag, the assignment cannot be submitted: 2.4 Form Group Module This module is useful in labeling a specific part of a job. When you need to label both the whole job and a specific part of it, you can drag a form group module into the template before adding necessary components into the form group. For instance, the audio labeling template below requires an operator to determine the validity of the whole audio clip; in contrast, he/she only has to label the role and sex of a speaker from a particular part of the whole clip: this is when a form group module is needed to include two single-choice modules for labeling the role and sex. This is how the template is shown in the labeling interface: 2.5 Tag Module The tag module supports two types of tags: single tag and tag group. You can select either of them through [Set tag type]. For a single tag, the administrator can click the \u201csettings\u201d icon on its right to set attributes of the tag: color, code name, necessity, maximum/minimum width and height for labeling, as well as an example image for the tag (to help the operator better understand it). 2.5.1 Set Tag Color In the attribute settings, you can click on the palette to choose different colors for each tag. The picture below shows tags in different colors in the labeling interface: The picture below shows tags in different colors in the audit interface (mark image): The picture below shows tags in different colors in the audit interface (mask image): 2.5.2 Set Tag Display Name Setting a display name for each tag could help the operator better grasp the meaning of the tag, as is demonstrated in the following picture: 2.5.3 Specify Width and Height Limits The picture below shows how to set the width and height limits for each tag: In the image below, when labeling, if an operator draws a rectangle that does not meet width or height limits, the rectangle will be filled with red to warn the operator of the error. And when the operator finishes drawing, the rectangle will disappear from the page without saving the result. For a labeling rectangle, when its width or height does not meet the limits that are added after the rectangle is drawn, adjustment mode will be activated to inform the operator to \u201cadjust the size of the figure as it exceeds the limits of the selected tag.\u201d If the operator refuses to adjust it, the labeling result will be discarded and the rectangle will disappear. The correct one will be save as below 2.5.4 Set Tag Necessity When you set a tag as \u201cnecessary\u201d, a necessity icon will appear to the left of it to remind the operator that this tag is a must-have in the assignment. This attribute should be used along with the data cleaning module. When an operator submits a job, the system will verify if any necessary tag has been selected. The operator will be sent an error warning when a necessary tag is not selected in the assignment. 2.5.5 Set a Sample Image This feature allows you to add a sample image for each tag, so that an operator can better comprehend the annotating rules. The following image shows how sample images are shown in the annotating interface: 3.User Management After logging in to the Admin platform, click [User Management], you can check all the users on admin and team platform that belong to the same tenant. You can search users by type, creation time, status etc. and also create new users or set tags for the users. 4.Team Management (Admin Manager) 4.1 Create and Edit Team 4.1.1 Create Team After logging in to the Admin platform, click [Team Management], and then click [Create new]. Enter basic information about your team in a pop-up window. Set [Status] as \u201cApproved\u201d , and then click [Save]. Now you have successfully created a team. 4.1.2 Edit team Find a target team on the team list, and click the [Edit] button on the right. After you have edited information, click [Save] to keep the changes. 4.2 Add/Remove Team Members(Admin Manager) 4.2.1 Add member When the project administrator/manager logs in to the Admin platform, he/she can go to [Team Management] to find a target team on the list before clicking the [Manage] button on the right. Click [Create new] Enter information about the new member in a pop-up window, and click [Save] to finish the addition. In the pop-up window, you can choose multiple roles for a member to determine the scope of his/her permissions. 4.2.2 Edit and Remove Member Find a target account on the member list, and then click [Edit] or [Remove] on the right based on your needs. 4.2.3 Add/Remove a Member(Team Manager) 4.2.3.1 Add a Single Member When the team manager logs in to the Team platform, he/she can click [Team Members] on the left panel to enter the team member list, and then click the [Create a user] button. Enter basic information about the new member and select roles. Click [Save] to complete the addition. In the pop-up window, you can choose multiple roles for a member to determine the scope of his/her permissions. At least one group must be set in advance before you select a group for the new member. 4.2.3.2 Add Multiple Members Click the [Batch import user] button above the team member list. Click [Click to download Excel template] to download the template for importing members. Open the Excel template on your computer, input information about new members, and save the file. Information you need to provide in the template: nickname, password, email address, and mobile phone number. When importing multiple users, you cannot choose roles for them. Their roles are all set as \u201coperator\u201d by default, which can be changed later. After filling out the template, the team manager needs to upload it and click [Next step]. After uploading, you can check the information loaded from the template. If the information is correct, click [Import], otherwise you need to edit your Excel file and click [Re-select Excel File] to upload it again. If a system notification appears on the upper-right corner of the screen telling you that the importation is complete, it means you have successfully imported multiple team members. 4.2.3.3 Remove a Member When the team manager finds a target member on the member list, he/she can remove the member from the team by clicking the [Delete] button on the right. The team manager is not allowed to remove himself/herself. 4.2.3.4 Edit a member Click [Check] to enter the details page of a member, and then click the [Edit] button on the right. After editing the member\u2019s information, click the [Save] button. 5.

Workflow Overview Each Project starts with a detailed set of requirements. The BasicAI team will work with the customer to develop detailed requirements and create annotation template(s) for each Task, using the Admin module of OnPrem platform. We will send client requirement sheet to the BPO Team Manager through email. The BPO team needs to see the requirements carefully and arrange the Operators/Workers according to the volume and delivery time. Your team can ask us any questions they may have and give us the working plan, such as total number of Operators/Workers, Operators/Workers for each batch, estimated time of completion, etc. For Projects with a large volume of data, normally we will give you Tasks in batches. After total understanding of the requirements, the Operators/Workers can begin their annotation work. 1.1 Changes to Requirements Customer users have access to a dashboard in their Admin module that enables them to track Project progress and also review results as they are produced. BasicAI OnPrem is designed to enable customers to make any necessary adjustments at the beginning of a Project, which is much more efficient than doing rework at the end of a Project if the customer\u2019s requirements were not entirely correct. If customers make changes to their requirements after the Project has started, we may need to make changes to their template as well. The BasicAI team will inform the designated Team Manager of any new requirements or changes to existing requirements in a timely manner. We expect the Team Manager will inform its Operators/Workers of any changes, the Operators/Workers with conform to the new requirements going forward, and additional QC may be required for labeling done prior to the changes. 1.2 Communication During each Project, we rely on timely communication through email, slack, or agreed upon social media, so that both parties can address issues as they arise. 1.3 Quality Inspection After executing each Task, the supervisors of your BPO team should audit all of the work performed by your team, before submitting to BasicAI for Audit and approval. BasicAI closely monitors the productivity and error rates of its partners in order to provide its clients with the best results possible. Low productivity and/or high error rates lead to lower volumes of business that we are able to source through your BPO firm, so it is important to internally monitor your own metrics. 2.

System Management"},{"location":"team/","text":"BasicAI OnPrem Platform: Team Module This is an outline of the Team Module, which is to be accessed by managers and Operator/Workers from BPO affiliate partners in order to review and execute assigned tasks. Platform Login As a Team Operator/Worker/Manager, you will log into the platform through below URL https://team.sandbox.basic.ai/login 1 Workflow Overview Each Project starts with a detailed set of requirements. The BasicAI team will work with the customer to develop detailed requirements and create annotation template(s) for each Task, using the Team module of BasicAI Onplatform. We will send client requirement sheet to the BPO Team Manager through email. The BPO team needs to see the requirements carefully and arrange the Operator/Workers according to the volume and delivery time. Your team can ask us any questions they may have and give us the working plan, such as total number of Operator/Workers, Operator/Workers for each batch, estimated time of completion, etc. For Projects with a large volume of data, normally we will give you Tasks in batches. After total understanding of the requirements, the Operator/Workers can begin their annotation work. 1.1 Changes to Requirements Customer users have access to a dashboard in their Admin module that enables them to track Project progress and also review results as they are produced. BasicAI Cloud is designed to enable customers to make any necessary adjustments at the beginning of a Project, which is much more efficient than doing rework at the end of a Project if the customer\u2019s requirements were not entirely correct. If customers make changes to their requirements after the Project has started, we may need to make changes to their template as well. The BasicAI team will inform the designated Team Manager of any new requirements or changes to existing requirements in a timely manner. We expect the Team Manager will inform its Operator/Workers of any changes, the Operator/Workers with conform to the new requirements going forward, and additional QC may be required for labeling done prior to the changes. 1.2 Communication During each Project, we rely on timely communication through email, slack, or agreed upon social media, so that both parties can address issues as they arise. 1.3 Quality Inspection After executing each Task, the supervisors of your BPO team should audit all of the work performed by your team, before submitting to BasicAI for Audit and approval. BasicAI closely monitors the productivity and error rates of its partners in order to provide its clients with the best results possible. Low productivity and/or high error rates lead to lower volumes of business that we are able to source through your BPO firm, so it is important to internally monitor your own metrics. 2 Task Assignment (Team Manager) After the project administrator completes the project configuration in the background, on the team platform, the team manager could assign tasks by clicking [Team Task] to view the received tasks. 2.1 Set Operator/Worker Click [Set Operator/Worker] to set the executor for the task In the task list. This shows all members of the current team. Check the box to the left of the list to give the corresponding Operator/Worker permission to execute the task. (Check it to be granted permission, no need to save) When setting up people, we can find the specified users by searching, filtering their groups, and filtering user tags. 3.Task Execution (Team Operator/Worker) 3.1 Check Available Tasks When an Operator/Worker logs in to the Team platform, he/she can view the Task list that has been assigned to them by clicking [My Tasks]. Click [Execute] for a specific Project to begin your work. 3.2 Task Execution Instructions The user interface for Task Execution is divided into three areas: Basic Job Information Basic Job Operations Annotation Area 3.2.1 Basic Job Information [Job Performance] This area displays the daily performance on current job by the Operator/Worker. [Assignment/Job info] When the mouse is placed over the [Assignment ID] , the details of the Job will show up. If you are having a problem with any Job, take notes of the details including the Project, Assignment, and Task IDs for later reference. [Done] This area displays the number of Jobs done/the number of Jobs claimed by the Operator/Worker, as well as the remaining execution time for the current Job. 3.2.2 Basic Job Operations [Pend/Difficult Job] By clicking this button, you can pause the Job while keeping it under the name of the current Operator/Worker. The Team Manager can check the Job in his/her [Team Tasks] panel. The Operator/Worker can use this function to keep doing subsequent Jobs while consulting the Team Manager. Once the administrator provides instructions, the Operator/Worker can quickly find the Job again in [My Tasks] in order to finish it. [Quit] Clicking this button will exit the execution interface without submitting the Job currently in execution mode. Any claimed Job that have not been executed will be sent back to the Job pool for other Operator/Workers to complete. [Submit and Quit] Click this button to submit the current Job and leave the execution interface. Any claimed Job that have not been executed will be sent back to the Job pool for other Operator/Workers to complete. [Submit] Click the button to submit current Job and move on to the next Job. [?] Hover the mouse over this icon to check hotkeys for this template. [View previous and next job] This button is unique to image annotating as it enables you to check the previous and next images in a pop-up window. It is quite helpful when it comes to annotating a project where adjacent images are relevant to each other. You can also check the images in larger size by clicking the preview images. 3.2.3 Annotation Area In the Annotation Interface, you will find a combination of components and layouts that vary for different kinds of Task. These are configured at the Template level. The layout of templates in different categories will be explained later in the introduction of different annotation types. 3.2.4 Annotation Types 3.2.4.1 Text Annotation The text annotation interface is divided into three areas by default: text display, tag selection, and results.

After adding the first split line, the audio will be cut into two clips, with two corresponding results being generated in the results and transcripts area. Each of the results is deemed valid by default. When you double click the transcript column, you can transcribe the clip. For instance, number 1 and number 2 are recorded as the transcript content for the two results in the image above. A selected clip will be highlighted in red in the audio annotating sector, and its result will be highlighted in blue on the result list. By clicking the [Play] button at the front of each row, you can play the corresponding clip. If you have the [Loop] box checked, the clip will be played over and over. Select attributes for each result in the tags area on the right. The selected attributes will be shown on the result list. [Add] For example, in the image above, the third clip, which has been transcribed, will be cut into two clips when a split line is added, and its transcript content will be saved in the first one of the two newly generated clips (see image below). [Delete] In the image above, if you want to delete the second clip, you need to select it on the result list, and find the corresponding piece of waveform above. Then you need to find the split line on its right, above which there is a red point that you need to click to delete the second clip. Once the second clip is deleted, the transcript content in it will be merging with that of the third clip. You can also revise or delete the merged content if needed. #### 3.2.4.3.3.Hotkey for Audio Annotation [D] Submit 3.2.4.4 Video Annotation 3.2.4.4.1 Video Segmentation Create a video segmentation project at admin platform. Pay attention to the video data format.We should upload video data in .zip format, this is different from Object tracking, which we should upload video in .mp4 format. Create a video segmentation template at Root or Admin platform before creating a project or during project configuration, or use the existing video segmentation template accordingly. After completing the project configuration, go to Team platform to start annotation. There are [Create] Button for creating new video segmentations, also [Fast-forward] and [Fast-backward] button for adjusting video play, you can also change the duration for fast-forward or fast-backward. Click the [Play] button at the center of the video, you can play the video. The example project is to annotating goal time. Click [Create] you will see some new button, where you can[Set Start Time] and [Set End Time] by filling the time manually or clicking the clock UI to set the time automatically. Click [Save] or [Cancel] to save or cancel your record/annotation. After clicking [Save] you will see the record at the Result list area, you can choose a tag accordingly. Click the record, you can modify your record/annotation. You can also see your record at the bottom of the video layout area, the annotated segmentation will be shown in yellow at the timeline area. 3.2.4.4.2 Object Tracking Object Tracking is an annotation type for annotate videos/images, tracking objects in the videos/images. We can create a template first in root/admin for Object Tracking. And use it for annotation. And then create a project, select Object Tracking. For this step, pay attention, for images/pictures, we should only upload them by zip. however, for video data we should upload a video directly in.mp4 format or videos one by one instead of packing them in.zip format, it does not work for videos in zip, this is different from other video annotation, which we should upload video in .zip format. And then publish the project. When it comes to Configuration Page, choose Annotation Type by selecting the template we have created. Then do all the continuous steps as usual, after finish configuration, go to team platform and execute the task. We will use the button in red rectangular and also the normal tags for mark the video.If you click Next Frame, you can check each frame of the video to track the video more accurately. For example if this project requires you to track face in the video. Click \u201cNew\u201d and draw a box on the face in the video, you will see a colorful rectangular box, the one show in the below is yellow rectangular box. You can also remove, make it shown or not see step 3 in the below image. If the next frame,If next frame, the face moves, use the mouse to move it so as to track the face, the yellow box should be moved to what the green box is. If there is no face in the next frame, just untick or uncheck the \u201cShown\u201d, and you will find the yellow box disappears. If there is face again in the next frame, tick/check \u201cShown\u201d again so as to retrack the face. Besides, you can also annotate with the tags on the left as all the other projects. However, the problem is Object Tracking is still in development and needs to be improved, you will find that you can not move the yellow box on the video. 3.2.4.5 Sensor Annotation 3.2.4.5.1 3D Point Cloud Annotation How to create: Before we create the project, we need to make sure that we have already have pcd file data and 2D images from client. For unprojected 3D point cloud annotation project, use the client given pcd file (zip) and do data deployment on platform. In Cloud(Saas) platform, (In system management) upload the pcd data file and then download the excel file which is generated from platform once you upload the pcd data file. Then create the project and upload the excel file. And configure the project as usual. If client want point cloud tracking, just to make sure that client given data is frame by frame (pcd) If you want to create the project (projected with 2D images), then when we do the data deployment we need to upload both 2D images and pcd file together in the same file. 3.2.4.5.2 3D Point Cloud Tracking In one task, it can receive less than 100 consecutive 3D point cloud data at once. The worker/operator needs to mark all the data that has been received one frame by one frame. And click submit button to submit the entire task. Button Instruction Copy annotation result to next frame: Copy the annotation result of the current frame to the next frame. Previous frame: View previous frame View next frame Play: From current frame to the rest of the frame. Current frame/ Total frame Path line: After click Pathline, it will have a blue line showing the movement track of the center point of the marked object. Delete Operation In annotation list, there is a delete key, delete the current result of the current object. Delete (all frame): delete current object\u2019s annotation result in all frame. Delete all (current frame): Delete all of the annotation results of the current frame Delete (all frame): Delete all of the annotation results in all of the frame. (With caution) How to After annotating all the required object in the first frame, then click copy to next frame button and then goes to the next frame. Until all the frames is annotated. Then click the play button to check all the annotation result. Precautions The system does not support copying the result to the previous frame, so it is necessary to mark the objects in the current frame and then go to the next frame. In the point cloud tracking, the same object annotation result has the same size in different frames. Therefore, when one annotation result is adjusted in length, width and height, the size of the annotation result will be adjusted in all frames, but the position and direction of the annotation result will not change together. When the continuous frame is not loaded, a black screen will appear when the next frame of the previous frame is quickly clicked, and the point cloud data will be displayed when the loading is completed. When annotate more than 50frames, There will be about 4 seconds, please wait patiently, don't refresh the page. After more overlapping cubes, each time you move the work area, you may see that the rendered graphics are not the same every time, but it does not affect the results. The upper limit of the labeling result is 5000. If the number of job frames exceeds 100 after the job is received, more than 50 annotations need to be marked in a single frame. Please suspend the job and feed back the job ID to the production administrator. 3.2.4.5.3 3D Point Cloud Cuboid (General) Create Cube Create Click Create (Hotkey N) A red dot following the mouse appears and enter into the create mode Left mouse click on the corresponding position in the 3D point cloud map to start the new creation, click the left mouse button again to end the new creation. The 3 views of the cube drawn on the right side of the 3D point cloud are top view, side view, and rear view from top to bottom, and the corresponding length, width, and height appear in the upper right corner of the view, in meters. Adjust After the 3D cube is created, we need to resize the cube in the 3 view so that it fits the marked object. Left mouse click to drag the blue key of the rectangle in the 3 view, and the rectangular frame in the 3 view is attached to the edge of the marked object. The adjustment of the 3 view will be synchronized to the 3D point cloud map. Rotate In some 3D point cloud annotation requirements, the direction of the front head is required. The yellow arrow in the cube and 3 views represents the direction of the front head. Rotate the cube when labeling so that the direction of the arrow points in the direction of the front. There are two ways to rotate: The first way: Rotate the cube in a 3D point cloud map Select the cube to be adjusted, left click the [Rotate] button, or the shortcut key R. In the 3D point cloud map, there will be a blue arc around the cube. Press the left mouse button to hold the diamond point at the center of the arc. The blue arc will change to lavender. The mouse will swing left and right and the cube will rotate left and right. Second way: Rotate the point cloud in the top view map In the top view map, click left mouse the area outside the key point of the rectangle and rotate the background of the man and let the yellow arrow downward. Move Select the cube to be adjusted, click the [Move] button, or the shortcut key T. The selected object will have a coordinate centered on the selected cube. Click on the center point (image in red area- white point) of the cube to drag the object ( in a whole), click on the blue line, and move the cube only in the vertical direction (up or down). The green line is only for moving forward or backward direction and the red line is only for moving the left or right direction View adjustment Drag the map: In 3D point cloud map, right click then you can drag the map. Zoom in /zoom out: mouse wheel control Control camera angle\uff1a[Up] [Down] [Left] [Right] key controls the camera angle to turn up, down, left, and right.

Each of the results is deemed valid by default. When you double click the transcript column, you can transcribe the clip. For instance, number 1 and number 2 are recorded as the transcript content for the two results in the image above. A selected clip will be highlighted in red in the audio annotating sector, and its result will be highlighted in blue on the result list. By clicking the [Play] button at the front of each row, you can play the corresponding clip. If you have the [Loop] box checked, the clip will be played over and over. Select attributes for each result in the tags area on the right. The selected attributes will be shown on the result list. [Add] For example, in the image above, the third clip, which has been transcribed, will be cut into two clips when a split line is added, and its transcript content will be saved in the first one of the two newly generated clips (see image below). [Delete] In the image above, if you want to delete the second clip, you need to select it on the result list, and find the corresponding piece of waveform above. Then you need to find the split line on its right, above which there is a red point that you need to click to delete the second clip. Once the second clip is deleted, the transcript content in it will be merging with that of the third clip. You can also revise or delete the merged content if needed. #### 3.2.4.3.3.Hotkey for Audio Annotation [D] Submit","title":"3.2.4.3 Audio Annotation"},{"location":"team/#3244-video-annotation","text":"","title":"3.2.4.4 Video Annotation"},{"location":"team/#32441-video-segmentation","text":"Create a video segmentation project at admin platform.

And then publish the project. When it comes to Configuration Page, choose Annotation Type by selecting the template we have created. Then do all the continuous steps as usual, after finish configuration, go to team platform and execute the task. We will use the button in red rectangular and also the normal tags for mark the video.If you click Next Frame, you can check each frame of the video to track the video more accurately. For example if this project requires you to track face in the video. Click \u201cNew\u201d and draw a box on the face in the video, you will see a colorful rectangular box, the one show in the below is yellow rectangular box. You can also remove, make it shown or not see step 3 in the below image. If the next frame,If next frame, the face moves, use the mouse to move it so as to track the face, the yellow box should be moved to what the green box is. If there is no face in the next frame, just untick or uncheck the \u201cShown\u201d, and you will find the yellow box disappears. If there is face again in the next frame, tick/check \u201cShown\u201d again so as to retrack the face. Besides, you can also annotate with the tags on the left as all the other projects.
